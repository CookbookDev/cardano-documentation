Ada held on the Cardano network represents a user’s
stake in the protocol, the size of which is proportional to the amount of ada
held. Users who hold a stake in Cardano can get passive rewards for delegating it to stake pool operators. The amount of rewards they can get is proportional to the amount of ada
they pledge or delegate.

There are three options ada holders can consider for delegating their stake:

1. Run their own stake pool
2. Agree with a third party to run a private stake pool for them
3. Delegate to other stake pools.

Stake pools must maintain **high-availability**, which means that they should
_always_ be online and available to validate and create new blocks. The rewards
a stake pool can earn are directly proportional to the amount of ada 
pledged or delegated, and the number of blocks the stake pool can create in a
given epoch. Ouroboros elects the slot leader that grants the permissions to
validate transactions and create new blocks, based on the above criteria.

:::note

Note that it is **strongly recommended** to test all stake pool functionality on
Cardano [testnets](/cardano-testnets/environments) _prior_ to any mainnet deployment.

## Pledging

The [pledge](/learn/pledging-rewards) is the amount of ada that the stake pool operator ‘delegates’ to
their own pool when it is created. This pledge represents the operator's
commitment to maintain their pool and support network activity. Making a pledge
is not required, however, it is recommended to pledge _some_ ada to the stake
pool prior to running it. The more ada that is pledged, the higher the pool
rewards, which are dependent on the pool’s level of uptime and its performance.

## Delegation

Ada holders who do not have technical expertise in maintaining a stake pool can
earn rewards by delegating to any stake pool available on the network. The
[Daedalus wallet](https://daedaluswallet.io/)
provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to start delegating to any
registered stake pool.

:::note

Ada holders and stake pool operators who pledge or delegate will
always have access to their ada. If the delegated ada is spent or removed from
the pool, the rewards decrease accordingly.

:::

## Rewards

Delegators get rewards for participating in staking (either pledging or
delegating), and these rewards are automatically distributed between the
participants according to the rewards scheme. The rewards scheme in Cardano is
designed to be decentralized, which means that there is no single controlling
party.
