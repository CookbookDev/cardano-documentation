Cardano testnets sit at the vanguard of network development, providing sandboxed
environments for continuing innovation, harnessing the power of the Cardano
community to iterate and improve.

Stake pool operators, exchanges, smart contract developers, and projects can
engage with different early-stage and pre-production networks to actively test
core Cardano functionality prior to deploying on mainnet.
