Smart contracts on Cardano are simple programs often refered to as validator scripts in which you define custom logic. 
They are automatically executed (by each Cardano node validating your transaction) when a transaction attempts to move funds that currently reside at the scripts address. 
The address of each script is derived from the hash-sum of the compiled script. 

Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable as a contract cannot be changed, they are distributable and tamper-proof, fast and cost effective, as there is no middle man which saves money and time.

## Tooling & Languages

Cardano introduced smart contract support in 2021. As a multi-functional
environment, Cardano now supports the development and deployment of smart
contracts using such programming languages as:

- **Plutus** — a purpose-built smart contract development and execution
  platform. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain
  (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or client
  code). Plutus draws from modern language research to provide a safe,
  full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading functional
  programming language.
- **Marlowe** — a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing and executing
  financial contracts that allows building contracts visually as well as in more
  traditional code. Financial institutions can use it to develop and deploy
  custom instruments for their customers and clients, for example. The Marlowe
  language itself is now embedded in both JavaScript, TypeScript and Haskell offering a
  choice of editors depending on developers’ preference and skillset.
- **Aiken** - for on-chain validator scripts only: a language & toolchain favouring developer experience.
- **OpShin** - a programming language for generic Smart Contracts based on Python. 
- **plu-ts** - Typescript-embedded smart contract programming language and a transaction creation library.
