## Redelegation

In this part we will show how to redelegate our ADAs to another Stake Pool. There can be multiple reasons to redelegate our ADAs, but the most common ones are:

- Original Stake Pool is no longer available.
- You've discovered a more convinient option.
- You have your own Stake Pool and you want to delegate your ADAs to it.

To do that we need to create a new certificate that we are sending in a transaction just like we did in the first part of the tutorial.
```
cardano-cli stake-address delegation-certificate \
    --stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
    --stake-pool-id pool1vzqtn3mtfvvuy8ghksy34gs9g97tszj5f8mr3sn7asy5vk577ec \
    --out-file new-delegation.cert
```
Now it contains the `--stake-pool-id` of the new Stake pool. It means that we're ready to construct our transaction, selecting first the UTxO from which we will pay for the fee.
```
$ cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr)
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount

```

```
cardano-cli transaction build \
    --witness-override 2 \
    --tx-in 2b1bfc342c1f5531df4cfa220eac79574142c7263d97885d2ad8588ca1a7e22b#0 \
    --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \
    --certificate new-delegation.cert \
    --out-file new-delegation.tx

cardano-cli transaction sign \
    --tx-file new-delegation.tx \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey \
    --signing-key-file stake.skey \
    --out-file new-delegation.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit --tx-file new-delegation.signed 
```
If we check our stake address info we'll see that we have delegated our ADAs to a new Stake Pool and we have zero rewards:

```
$ cardano-cli query stake-address-info --address $(cat stake.addr)
[
    {
        "address": "stake_test1uq954t492tmusk2dy9z505g3cz3sfpnh0swsqjmzk47rasqyn8uqp",
        "delegation": "pool1vzqtn3mtfvvuy8ghksy34gs9g97tszj5f8mr3sn7asy5vk577ec",
        "rewardAccountBalance": 0
    }
]
```
