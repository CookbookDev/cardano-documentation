## What is SC_Token?

**SC_Token<sup>1</sup>** is the native token of the proof of concept EVM sidechain testnet. `SC_Token` can be moved between the main chain (Cardano) and the EVM sidechain, and `SC_Token` is required to pay for gas. Test `SC_Token` carries no real-world value.

### What is gas?

**Gas** refers to the computational cost necessary to successfully conduct a transaction on the sidechain network. This gas is deducted from a small fraction of `SC_Token` when conducting a transaction, deploying a smart contract, or writing to a smart contract.

### How to get SC_Token?

IO Global has a open-sourced faucet at https://github.com/input-output-hk/sc-evm-faucet-web for testing purposes. The faucet dispenses test SC_Token that you can use to pay the gas fees on smart contracts that you run on the EVM sidechain testnet. You cannot swap the test SC_Token tokens you claim from the faucet for any other token, nor can you use them to make any purchases. 

## What is Test Ada?

Test Ada (`tAda`) is the native token of Cardano testnets. `tAda` is required to pay for transaction fees conducted on a Cardano testnet. `tAda` carries no real world value.

### How to get tAda? 

Request test ada using a public Cardano testnet faucet: https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/
