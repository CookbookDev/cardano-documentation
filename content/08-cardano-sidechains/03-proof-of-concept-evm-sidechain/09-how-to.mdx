## Step 01 - Run Cardano testnet

Before setting up and running a sidechain (EVM sidechain), it is essential to establish and configure a mainchain (Cardano testnet). A mainchain serves as the foundation for the sidechain, providing the necessary infrastructure and security. You can create your own testnet or utilize a public testnet for the deployment of your sidechain.

## Step 02 - Deploy mainchain scripts to mainnet

For a sidechain to function efficiently, a set of scripts needs to be deployed on the mainchain. These scripts play a crucial role in managing the policies and validators of the sidechain, ensuring its secure and smooth operation.

## Step 03 - Run DB Sync

DB Sync is a crucial component when it comes to enabling an EVM sidechain to listen to events on the Cardano mainnet. By integrating DB Sync into your sidechain infrastructure, you can establish a reliable connection that allows your sidechain to stay synchronized with the Cardano mainnet.

## Step 04 - Run EVM Sidechain validator node

Sidechain validator nodes are responsible for validating transactions, proposing and validating blocks, and maintaining the consensus mechanism within a sidechain network. These nodes ensure the integrity and security of the sidechain by participating in the block production process. However, before they can contribute, they must register with the sidechain committee.
